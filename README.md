# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª
This application was built using flutter.Without mixing words, this app basically calculates BMI which
stands for Body Mass Index and offers the end user suggestion based on the calculated BMI.
Disclaimer:
This app does not in any way replace medical consultations or advice.

#features and functionality
The app has a dropdown that allows the user to select the unit he wants.
It also has a range slider that allows the user to drag to pick a certain numerical
value. When the user clicks the calculate button, A BMI value and some necessary information
regarding that particular BMI value is sent to the user.

The app also allows the user to pick his gender via a select card widget.
This though plays no part in the logic of the application.
